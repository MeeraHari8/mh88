        <p> I am very fond of reading books. My list of books would include everything from comics, fairytales, fiction, non-fiction, autobiographies etc. </p>
        <p > Reading helps you to bringout your creativity. It takes you to a totally different world where you are completely exploring it on your own. Reading also helps one in improving concentration, vocabulary. Reading is like a meditation which just helps you unwind the stress after a long day.<br> My favourite books includes the "Harry Potter Series" .
